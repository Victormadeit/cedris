## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed API Dependencies** - No more `api.js` or backend calls
2. **Static Product Gallery** - Hardcoded product showcase instead of dynamic loading
3. **Local Order Storage** - Orders saved to localStorage instead of database
4. **Simplified Contact** - Form saves locally instead of sending emails
5. **Fixed Image References** - Corrected all broken image paths

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Navigate through the site using the top menu
3. Try the design editor to create custom products
4. Place orders (stored locally for demo purposes)

## Payment Integration

The site includes MTN MoMo payment integration with merchant code **611960**. In a real deployment, you would need to:

1. Set up proper payment processing
2. Connect to a backend for order management
3. Add email notifications

## Development

This is a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript website with no build process required. Simply edit the files and refresh your browser to see changes.
